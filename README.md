# SupportService

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/SupportService.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/SupportService)

SupportService is a simple application built in flask, that can be used to demonstrate the use of feature flags in action. All of the source code can be downloaded from github and run locally your machine. The following are instructions on how to install the application and how to configure it so you can run the demo environment on your local machinge.

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/launchdarkly/SupportService/wiki) for
more information on specific feature flags and use cases.

## Installation

### Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Instructions

* Clone the repo locally `git clone https://github.com/launchdarkly/SupportService.git`
* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the correct values:

        export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://supportService:supportService@db/supportService
        export LD_CLIENT_KEY=$YOUR_SDK_KEY
        export LD_FRONTEND_KEY=$YOUR_FRONTEND_ID

* Source the environment variables `source .env`
* Start up the stack with `docker-compose up`

The app should now be running on localhost:5000

## Using the CLI

There is a `cli.py` that exposes some deployment functionality. This allows you
to run the same deployment locally that CircleCI is running for this project.

In order to use it in a standalone way you need to add some additional environment
varibales to your `.env` file:

    export LD_API_KEY=
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=
    export AWS_HOSTED_ZONE_ID=

You can run `python cli.py` to see the help for the cli.

## Running in Production

**Note: this section only applies to LaunchDarkly employees.**

There is a production instance of this application running for every
environment that is defined in the `support-service` project in our demo
environment.

If you need your own environment simply make a new environment inside of this
project. This will trigger a deployment via CircleCI that will provision a
new instance on AWS Lightsail.

After a few minutes will be available at `$YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_KEY.ldsolutions.org`.

### Updating in Production

Every time that there is a commit to the master branch of this repo, a deployment
runs via CircleCI to update all existing instances on AWS LightSail to the latest
version of master.

## Simulator
There is a selenium based "simulator" that lives under the `webdriver` directory.
This is used to provide a steady stream of activities against all current demo
sites so that the insights graphs for various feature flags are populated.

Right now it runs every hour via a CircleCI job. You can see the use pattern in
the `.circle/config.yml` file under the `simulate` job.

### Running it Locally

1. Go to the webdriver directory: `cd webdriver`
2. Compile the maven project: `mvn compile assembly:single`
3. Start the simulator with: `java -jar target/webdriver-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
